### What I accomplished 

+ Performed feature engineering to extract crucial URL-based attributes, creating a dataset for model development.
+ Developed an ensemble model using logistic regression, KNN, decision tree, Naive Bayes, and MLP neural network.
+ Achieved 96\% testing accuracy by training and testing the model, clearly showcasing strong predictive performance.
